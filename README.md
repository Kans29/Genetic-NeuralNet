# Genetic-NeuralNet

The idea was to merge a genetic algorithm with a neural net to solve a decision problem.

I used the genetic algoritm to find the best possible combination of bias and edge weigth to create a neuralNet and solve a certain problem


The problem is listed in the repository with the training / testing cases.

Common - Lisp
